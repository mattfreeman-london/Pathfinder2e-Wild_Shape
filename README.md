# Pathfinder2e-Wild_Shape

An online resource to help with the stats adjustments when using Wild Shape in Pathfinder 2e. Using Wild Shape in Pathfinder Second Edition comes with a lot of adjustments to various character stats, and so the intent of the project is to allow you to enter your characters attributes modifiers, their level, their chosen feats, and any other relevant bonuses, and to see a list of available forms and their relevant combat statistics, movements speeds, and so on.
